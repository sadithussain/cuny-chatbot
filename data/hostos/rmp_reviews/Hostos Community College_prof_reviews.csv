He's boring, gives an exam every week and he gets paranoid and very intense on the day of the exam, HE TAKES YOUR CELL PHONE like you're an elementary school student until you finish the exam and tells the students that if they see someone cheating to tell him. He doesn't relax for a minute. Attendance is important.","Dec 15th, 2022",Hostos Community College

No homework, no extra credit, essentially no other way of getting points toward your grade. Tries to get fit entire complex topics into the schedule amount of time just for the sake of not falling behind, which results in him just flying thru the lecture.","Nov 17th, 2022",Hostos Community College

His accent is not strong and for those who claim they failed the class its because they did not listen to him. He explains the material very well so well its almost common sense.,"Jun 3rd, 2018",Hostos Community College
995205,Samuel Asante,Chemistry,CHE120,2.0,5.0,No Grade,5,0,I took him since the school changed the professor very last minute and there was no choice. Organic chemistry itself is hard and his class doesn't make it easier. No extra credit. I feel bad to say but he has strong accent.

FIVE STEPS TO CHOOSING YOUR COLLEGE MAJOR,"1. Assess or evaluate your interests.
What are your passions?  What are you deeply interested in?  What types of things excite you? What kind of work appeals to you? Think about it and write this information down.
2. Take an honest look at your unique strengths and abilities.
What are you good at?  What are the things that you're better than most people at?  What were your best and most enjoyable subjects in high school? What activities and clubs were especially enjoyable to you? You were created with many different innate preferences and skills â€“ these are the ones that you should hone and refine, and so you should choose a major that uses those skills.  Think about it and write this information down.
3. It's all about values.
Consider the things you value in work, such as growth, fixing things, being around people, helping the needy, working under pressure, security, counseling others, working in groups, attention to detail, making things, and many other values.  Considering what kinds of jobs can meet these values can be helpful as you consider some career options.

5.  Do a feasibility check.
Ask yourself honestly: ""Does the career I have in mind match who I am?""  Be realistic.  Someone may wish to become an architect, but if he or she has little skills in math (geometry) and drawing, then perhaps the person should reconsider choosing that major. Sometimes there are ways to bypass these obstacles, but be wise and then you can avoid wasting your time and money on a wrong major.

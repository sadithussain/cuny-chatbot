Students Uplifting Ancestral Spaces,"Mission Statment:The primary goal of the Van Cortlandt African Burial Ground Project is to raise awareness and provide a place to show respect for the spirits of our ancestors and to promote the dedication of the enslaved people through research,
 service projects, and community forums.We recognize education as the first pillar of liberation. The involvement of scholars and academicians as guest speakers would allow for an accurate, comprehensive historical recount of the lives of enslaved Africans in the
 seventeenth century. With this knowledge being accessible to community members We will be able to reclaim our history.We place emphasis on community activism, engagement, and healing. Community forums will be held to give space to community members to express their grief and love for Our Ancestors. Whether it manifests in rage or sorrow, poetry
 or song, We welcome heaviness. We stress the importance of grieving in whichever way comes naturally, seeing as grief is proof of ongoing love.Historically, in spite of and because of the trauma of enslavement, the arts have always been a place of salvation for the Black community. From work songs to poetry, Black people are natural artists. This is why We welcome
 all Black creatives of different ages and experiences.

Our invitation to the community extends to spiritual leaders versed in Afro-centric grieving practices such as pouring libations and…   We employ these
 pillars (education, community engagement, creativity, and spirituality) separately and simultaneously because we expect to find healing in our grief and grief in our healing.
